# Breast-Cancer-Prediction

There are 2 types of tumors:
(i) Benign tumor: (0)
● It is not cancerous
● Capsulated
● Non-invasive
● Slow growing
● Do not spread to other body parts
● Cells are normal

(ii) Malignant tumor: (1)
● It is cancerous
● Not capsulated
● Fast growing
● They spread to other body parts
● Cells have large, dark nuclei and are abnormal in shape

*Dataset:
● Dataset is derived from fine needle aspiration, a type of biopsy procedure. In fine needle
aspiration, a thin needle is inserted into an area of abnormal-appearing tissue or body
fluid. As with other types of biopsies, the sample collected during fine needle aspiration
can help make a diagnosis or rule out conditions such as cancer.

-We are using logistic regression since it is a binary classification.
